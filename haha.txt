Meaningful memory you thought you had left
With some pretty bright and bubbly
In your memory 
In your memory 
It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess
In your memory 
Drunk on your awe to me
It doesn't mean anything at all
Oh comely
All of your friends are all letting you blow
Bristling and ugly
Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes
Of some pretty bright and bubbly
