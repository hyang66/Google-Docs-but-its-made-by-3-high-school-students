# Google Docs 
but its made by 3 high school students

##description
This is a text editor that allows people to edit not only files on thier own machine, but also files on the machines of others (given that they have the IP adress of the other person).


##bugs
1. hitting enter only works sometimes (and only on macs, it seems like)...
1. hitting up and down will add extra lines to the end of the file
1. unpredictable behavior when two people edit the same line

to install curses: sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
