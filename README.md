##description
This is a text editor that allows people to edit not only files on thier own machine, but also files on the machines of others (given that they have the IP adress of the other person).


##bugs
1. hitting enter only works sometimes (and only on macs, it seems like)...
1. hitting up and down will add extra lines to the end of the file
1. unpredictable behavior when two people edit the same line

to install curses: sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

to use this text editor:

## BUGS
If you press the down or up arrow too quickly, the characters will appear in the text editor.
Every time you change lines, whether it's due to up/down or enter, the shell is visible between redraws of the screen.
